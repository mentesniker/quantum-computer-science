    "## Solution\n",
    "To solve this one we need to take a more algorithmic approach. Or at least it was the way that helped me find a solution. Before I explain this algorithm please take note of the following: when you add a 1 to any bit it flips it's value. If it's already 1 then you have to sum a carry into the next bit which will flip the value of the next bit. To simulate this interaction in a quantum computer we can use controlled cx gates. For example to \"sum\" a carry over the third bit we need to make sure that the three preceding bits were one in order to flip the value of the third bit. So we can use a three controlled cx gate to achieve the same result. And for the second bit we have to do the same with a 2 controlled cx and so on for the rest of the bits. So the algorithm was: For each qubit in the input qubits calculate the controlled 4 cx gate over the 4 qubit, then calculate the controlled 3 cx gate over the 3 qubit, then calculate the controlled 2 cx gate over the 2 qubit, and finally calculate a cx over the first qubit."
