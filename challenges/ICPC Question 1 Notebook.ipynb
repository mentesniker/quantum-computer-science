When $\\theta(x) \\equiv 2\\pi$, implying $e^{i\\theta(x)} \\equiv 1$, the implementation is called phaseless.  We consider the phase $\\theta(x)$ irrelevant in what follows, which is consistent with measuring the $m$ output bits immediately after implementing the circuit. Allowing the phase to take different values depending on the input introduces a degree of freedom that can be explored to obtain shorter circuits, as there are fewer conditions for the circuit to satisfy.  The total number of qubits spanned by such a circuit is $n\\,{+}\\,m\\,{+}\\,S$.  Note that the $S$-qubit scratch space needs to be returned to value $|0\\rangle$ as otherwise, the implementation may not be used in quantum algorithms due to unwanted entanglement residing on the unreset scratch qubits.\n"

In other words sum all the bits and check for the first bit of the sum (which is the parity). So, in order to calculate the parity we just had to compute some cx gates to some ancilla qubit, then return the ancilla to 0 (it was a part of the requirements) and propagate the result to the output qubit. We had to do this because the cx gate have the same effect as doing a sum over a single bit (if it's 1 then it flip it back to 0 just like a sum of a 1 with a 0 or a 1). This first excercise was really simple."

    "Now for the second part, we had to calculate the sum for the second bit. Before digging any further please note this important fact: if we sum 4 bits which three of them are 1 then we'll have as a result 0011, and if we sum 4 bits which two of them are 1's then we'll have as a result 0010. And those are the only two possibilities for obtaining a 1 in the second bit of the output. So we have to check if two qubits are 1 or three are one. My approach to solve this was to use a toffoli gate to check all of the combinations of two bits. If an odd number of toffoli's gates were one then the result would have been one. This result gives us what we wanted earlier, to return a 1 only if two or three qubits were one."

The timeout for verification is set to $5$ minutes.  All implementations that time out or compute any of the popcount outputs incorrectly are assigned the score of ${+}\\infty$; the implementation with the smallest value of $\\text{Cost}$ wins."
