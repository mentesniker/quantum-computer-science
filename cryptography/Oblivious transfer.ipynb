    "## Problem description:\n",
    "Suppose that Alice wants to send two messages to Bob. Also, She wants to give the option to Bob to choose one of Her messages but She also wants to forbid the simultaneous reading of the two messages by Bob. That is, Bob can only read one of the messages depending on Bob's choice. Now, Bob doesn't want to make his choice visible for Alice. That is, only Bob can know what was his choice. To solve this problem we have to make the assumption that Alice and Bob will play by the rules no matter what. That is, Alice and Bob won't try to find the secret information of the other person."

So Alice sends them both encrypted (to avoid Alice knowing the choice of Bob) and Bob will only be able to read the message 0 but not both. The steps they have to follow are the following."

    "First step: Alice chooses two messages. Additionally, She creates a merge of the messages, appending one on top of the other. Then, She sends them encrypted to Bob. The encryption works as follows: For each bit in the bit String, She choses a random number in the set {0,1}. If the number is 1, She encrypts the choosen bit and She leaves the bit without encryption otherwise. Notice that it would be impossible for Bob to know which bits were encrypted and which weren't. And also, it would be imposible for Bob to know what message was on top of the other for the messageMerge. "
