    "Suppose that Alice wants to send two messages to Bob. Also, She wants for Bob to be able to read only one of her messages depending on Bob's choice. We also want to avoid Bob reading the two original messages from Alice, and avoid Alice being aware of the choice of Bob. Here we have the assumption that Alice and Bob will play by the rules no matter what."

So Alice sends them both encrypted (to avoid Alice knowing the choice of Bob) and Bob will only be able to read the message 0 but not both. The steps they have to follow are the following."
