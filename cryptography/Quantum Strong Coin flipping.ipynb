    "## Problem: \n",
    "Alice and Bob are on the telephone and they decide to flip a coin just for fun. But Alice can't see Bobs coin and viceversa because they are over the telephone. For the sake of the problem let's assume that both of them have access to a quantum computer and none of them want to cheat. As many other quantum cryptography algorithms it is necessary to make this kind of assumptions in order to get a useful result and we will see by the end of the post why this is necessary. So the proccess they have to follow is:"

But since Alice played by the rules, Alice bit will be random and the resul of the protocol will be random. So Bob can't force Alice Bit to be wherever He chooses because Alice will immediately notice the change. Another time where Bob could have choosen to cheat was the bit agreament protocol. In order to cheat He would choose to lie to Alice about their shared key (a, b, m0 and m1 bits). However Alice will notice because both of them have the same information so their must be the same.\n",
