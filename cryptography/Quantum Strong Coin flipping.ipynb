    "Let’s pretend for a moment that Alice and Bob are on the telephone and they have decided to flip a coin just for fun. Because they are over the telephone, Alice can’t see Bobs’s coin and vice versa. Additionally, let’s assume that both of them have access to a quantum computer and none of them want to cheat. (for the sake of the problem). This assumption is necessary in order to get a useful result. We’ll see why at the end of the post. For now let’s just concentrate on the process they have to follow:"

But since Alice played by the rules, Alice bit will be random and the result of the protocol will be random. So, Alice result will be different of Bob’s bit and then She’ll immediately know that Bob has cheated on the protocol. In other words, Bob can’t force Alice Bit to be wherever He chooses because Alice will immediately notice the change. Another time where Bob could have chosen to cheat was in the bit agreement protocol. In order to cheat He would choose to lie to Alice about their shared key (a, b bits). However, Alice will notice because both of them have the same information.\n",
